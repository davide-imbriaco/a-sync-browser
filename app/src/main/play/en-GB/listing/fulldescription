This project is an Android app, that works as a client for a Syncthing share (accessing Syncthing devices in the same way a client-server file sharing app access its proprietary server).

This is a client-oriented implementation, designed to work online by downloading and uploading files from an active device on the network (instead of synchronizing a local copy of the entire repository). This is quite different from the way the syncthing-android works, and its useful from those devices that cannot or wish not to download the entire repository (for example, mobile devices with limited storage available, wishing to access a syncthing share).
