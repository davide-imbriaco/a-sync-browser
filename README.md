# Syncthing Lite

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/syncthing/syncthing-lite.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/syncthing/syncthing-lite)
[![MPLv2 License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MPLv2-blue.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/)

This project is an Android app, that works as a client for a [Syncthing][1] share (accessing 
Syncthing devices in the same way a client-server file sharing app access its proprietary server). 

This is a client-oriented implementation, designed to work online by downloading and 
uploading files from an active device on the network (instead of synchronizing a local copy of 
the entire repository). This is quite different from the way the [syncthing-android][2] works, 
and its useful from those devices that cannot or wish not to download the entire repository (for 
example, mobile devices with limited storage available, wishing to access a syncthing share).

This project is based on [syncthing-java][3], a java implementation of Syncthing protocols.

## Translations

## Building

The project uses a standard Android build, and requires the Android SDK. The easiest option is if
you install [Android Studio][4] and import the project.

To compile with a development version of the [syncthing-java][3] library, you have to install it to
the local maven repository. To do this, clone the repo and run `gradle install` in the
syncthing-java project folder.
